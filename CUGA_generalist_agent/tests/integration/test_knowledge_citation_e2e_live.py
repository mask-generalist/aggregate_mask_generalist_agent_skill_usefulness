"""Opt-in LIVE-LLM smoke test for knowledge citations.

Gated behind @pytest.mark.e2e (the repo's real-service marker). Run explicitly,
with a real LLM + embedder configured:

    pytest tests/integration/test_knowledge_citation_e2e_live.py -m e2e -v -s

It runs ONE real chat turn that must cite an ingested doc, then asserts the
INVARIANT (robust to model nondeterminism): whatever citation-shaped markers the
model emitted were RESOLVED into [n] chips — no raw [sN] / 【sN】 / (sN) / … survive
— and every rendered chip number is backed by a source snapshot. If the model
declines to cite this run, the test SKIPS (not a regression). This is the net the
deterministic test cannot provide: it catches a *real* model emitting a marker
format the resolver doesn't handle (new drift) before it ships.

Caveats (why it's opt-in): it drives the SDK's OWN knowledge engine built from
settings, so it ingests a small doc into the configured knowledge store as a side
effect and needs a working LLM + embedder. It hard-skips if the agent/model/ingest
can't be set up in the current environment.
